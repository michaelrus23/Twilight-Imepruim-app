# Twilight-Imepruim-app
This app is aimed at making predictions of the battle results in board game "Twilight Imperium". \
Players resolve space combat by performing the following steps:
1. ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE: Each player’s units can use their “Anti-Fighter Barrage” abilities.
2. ANNOUNCE RETREAT: Either player may choose to
   announce a retreat. A retreat will not happen immediately;
   the units will retreat at the end of the combat round. \
   If a player wishes to retreat with any of his ground forces
   that are on planets in the active system, he must move
   them from planets to the space area during this step.
3. . MAKE COMBAT ROLLS: Each player rolls one die for
   each ship he has in the active system. If the result of a
   unit’s die roll is equal to or greater than that unit’s combat
   value shown on its faction sheet, that roll produces a hit.
   The total number of hits a player produces will be used in
   the next step. If a unit’s combat value contains two or more
   burst icons, the player rolls this number of dice
   instead, potentially producing one hit with
   each die rolled.
4. ASSIGN HITS: Each player must choose
   and destroy one of his ships for each hit his opponent
   produced. A player removes destroyed ships from the
   game board and places them in his reinforcements.Since players assign hits to their own units, it is a good
   strategy to assign hits to units that are cheaper to replace.
   Because of this, fighters are often used as fodder to
   protect the rest of a player’s ships.
5. RETREAT: If a player announced a retreat during the first
   step of the combat round, he retreats. To retreat, the player
   takes all of his ships from the combat and places them
   in an adjacent system. The chosen system cannot contain
   ships that belong to another player and must contain either
   a planet he controls or at least one of his units; otherwise,
   the player cannot retreat.If the chosen system does not contain one of that player’s
   command tokens, the player must place one token from
   his reinforcements in that system when he retreats.
6. End of Space Combat. \
   If both players have units remaining in the combat at the end of
   the “Retreat” step, they resolve another round of combat starting
   with the “Announce Retreat” step. After all units on one or both
   sides of the combat have been destroyed or have retreated, play
   proceeds to the invasion step.

The battle continues to the very end, when there are no ships left at least in one fleet.
